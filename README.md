# Installation
-Python 3.6
# Contextual-Chatbot-using-TensorFlow
1. Used Intent Classification for creating a contextual chatbot.
# Phase 1: Using NLP Concepts
2. Used Natural Language Processing Libraries like nlkt( Natural Language Toolkit).
3. Used packages like Tokenisation, Stemming, Lemmatization, Punctuation, Character Count, word count.
4. Libraries for TensorFlow processing includes- 
(i)Numpy(required for mathematical computation in terms of multi-dimensional arrays and matrices). 
(ii)TFLearn- High level abstraction layer for TensorFlow which is used for deep neural network by creating different layers.
(iii)random
(iv)JSON- for reading the 'Intent' file which is in JSON format.
5. Intent File- used for model training purpose. It contains components like 'Tags','Patterns', and 'Responses'.
# Phase 2 Preprocessing the data
The data is converted into whats known as a bag of words. This will allow us to feed numerical data to our model in the next phase.
# Phase 3 Building Neural Netwrok Model
Here a model is created that can classify the bag of words into a specific class. In the next part we will use the model to 
make predictions and generate responses.
